Privacy Policy
Last updated: December 6th 2025

1. Who we are
BestTextTools is available at https://BestTextTools.github.io.

Contact:
- GitHub issues: https://github.com/BestTextTools/BestTextTools.github.io/issues
- Email: besttexttools@gmail.com

2. What this site does
BestTextTools provides online text utilities such as text length counters, encoders, decoders, and hash generators. Most tools run directly in your browser.

3. Information we collect
Currently, BestTextTools does not intentionally collect personally identifiable information. No registration is required and no account data is stored.

In the future, we may add Cloudflare Web Analytics (free tier). This may collect aggregated, non-personal information such as:
- Pages visited
- Referrers
- Approximate location (region/city)
- Device, browser, and performance metrics

4. Third-party services (Ads & Analytics)
In the future, we plan to integrate:
- Google AdSense
- Media.net
- Cloudflare Web Analytics or similar tools

These services may use cookies or tracking technologies to deliver ads, measure performance, and prevent fraud. When such services are activated, this document will be updated.

5. How your data is processed
Currently, tool input is intended to run only in your browser.

In the future:
- Some features may send data to a backend server
- This will be clearly documented when implemented

6. Cookies and local storage
Future features may use browser storage to save preferences, support analytics, or support freemium features. Details will be added when these features are introduced.

7. Ads and freemium model
BestTextTools may become freemium in the future. The site may show advertisements which can collect data for ad performance and anti-fraud measures.

8. Children’s privacy
The site is general-purpose and does not target children. If a parent believes their child has submitted data, contact us for review.

9. Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may update this policy from time to time. Your continued use of the site constitutes acceptance of updated terms.
